      Spring Framework is a comprehensive and versatile platform for enterprise
      Java development. It is known for its Inversion of Control (IoC) and
      Dependency Injection (DI) capabilities that simplify creating modular and
      testable applications. Key features include Spring MVC for web
      development, Spring Boot for rapid application setup, and Spring Security
      for robust authentication and authorization. With a rich ecosystem
      covering Spring Data for database interactions and Spring Cloud for
      building microservices, Spring supports scalable and resilient enterprise
      solutions, making it an essential framework for developers of all
      experience levels.
