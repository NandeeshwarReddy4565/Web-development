      SQL databases are considered relational databases. They store related data
      in separate tables. When data is needed, it is queried from multiple
      tables to join the data back together. MongoDB is a document database
      which is often referred to as a non-relational database. This does not
      mean that relational data cannot be stored in document databases. It means
      that relational data is stored differently. A better way to refer to it is
      as a non-tabular database. MongoDB stores data in flexible documents.
      Instead of having multiple tables you can simply keep all of your related
      data together. This makes reading your data very fast. You can still have
      multiple groups of data too. In MongoDB, instead of tables these are
      called collections.
