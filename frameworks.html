      A framework is a structured platform that provides a base for application
      development, offering a set of tools, libraries, and guidelines to
      simplify the development process. It allows developers to avoid writing
      code from scratch, thereby speeding up the development process. For
      example, the .NET Framework is a specific framework for building client
      and server applications on Windows, which supports various application
      types and enhances performance. Overall, frameworks help streamline
      development by providing reusable components and a consistent structure.
