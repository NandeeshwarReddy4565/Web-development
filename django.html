      Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create web sites
      using Python. Django takes care of the difficult stuff so that you can
      concentrate on building your web applications. Django emphasizes
      reusability of components, also referred to as DRY (Don't Repeat
      Yourself), and comes with ready-to-use features like login system,
      database connection and CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete).
