      JavaScript has become popular for backend development due to several
      reasons: Unified Language: Using JavaScript for both frontend and backend
      development allows for code reusability, as developers can share code
      between the client and server. This reduces development time and effort,
      streamlining the development process and making maintenance easier.
      Asynchronous Nature: JavaScript's asynchronous programming model allows
      backend applications to handle multiple tasks concurrently without
      blocking the execution thread. This means that while one task is waiting
      for I/O operations (like reading from a database or making an API call),
      the application can continue executing other tasks, leading to better
      performance and responsiveness. Vibrant Ecosystem: JavaScript has a vast
      and vibrant ecosystem with a plethora of libraries, frameworks, and tools
      tailored for backend development.
